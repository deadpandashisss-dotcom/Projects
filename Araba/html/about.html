  <h2>Our Team’s Vision and Goals</h2>

  <p>
    This team is built not on age, but on personal quality and long-term goals.
    While forming the team, I carefully selected people who are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Respectful</li>
    <li>Responsible</li>
    <li>Not lazy</li>
    <li>Willing to improve themselves in the long term</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I have known most of the team members for a long time and trust their character.
    For this reason, disrespect, irresponsibility, or disorder is not tolerated within the team.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="team-values">
  <h2>Cooperation and Trust</h2>

  <p>
    The first and most important goal of the team is to create an environment of cooperation and trust.
    Sharing knowledge, supporting each other, and growing together form the foundation of the team.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="team-projects">
  <h2>Collaborative Projects and Portfolio</h2>

  <p>
    We aim to use the projects we develop together as a portfolio.
    Through this process, we will:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Learn how to work as a team</li>
    <li>Gain experience in task distribution and collaboration</li>
    <li>Complete larger projects in a shorter time</li>
    <li>Gain real-world experience</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="team-business">
  <h2>Real Projects and Earnings</h2>

  <p>
    When we find a client as a team and the project is too large to be completed individually:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Team members who wish to participate will join the project</li>
    <li>The work will be completed together</li>
    <li>Everyone involved will receive an equal share</li>
  </ul>
